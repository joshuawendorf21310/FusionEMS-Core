# PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS

## Baseline parity checklist
- Integration registry control-plane baseline established in backend.
- Remaining vendor parity modules queued in BUILD_QUEUE.

## Differentiators
- Encrypted per-tenant provider configuration with explicit enable/disable workflows.


## Narcotics module
- Parity: tenant-scoped controlled-med inventory, transfer/administer/waste logging, reconciliation-safe append-only log.
- Differentiator: explicit witness enforcement for schedule II waste/adjustments and strict non-negative balance guardrails.


## Assets + Fleet module
- Parity: vehicle readiness tracking, telemetry updates, maintenance scheduling/completion.
- Differentiator: strict optimistic concurrency for telemetry/maintenance lifecycle updates in tenant-scoped APIs.


## Fire module
- Parity: fire incident + inspection workflows with violation tracking and lifecycle state transitions.
- Differentiator: NERIS-first mapping scaffold with required-field validation and export stub generation for iterative conformance.


## HEMS module
- Parity: flight request lifecycle, crew availability windows, and paging event tracking.
- Differentiator: transition-map guarded status progression with tenant-scoped audit-safe operations.
